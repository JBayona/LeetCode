"""
Given a MxN matrix where each element can either be 0 or 1. We need to find
the shortest path between a given source cell to a destination cell.
The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1.
We can only move between 1, for 0 itÂ´s not allowed.

Expected time complexity is O(MN).
