/*
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given
stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but
you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6

// Three conditions:
// Buy
// Sell
// Hold
// Buy, then sell, then buy
// State of a given day depends on the state on prev day + action
// state[i] = state[i-1] + action
var maxProfit = function (prices, fee) {
  let sell = 0;
  let buy = -prices[0];
  for (let i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
    // This will become negative, thatÂ´s why we add up below
    buy = Math.max(buy, sell - prices[i]);
    // Buy is negative
    sell = Math.max(sell, prices[i] + buy - fee);
  }
