// Part 2
// Weâ€™ve added a percent threshold parameter. All other inputs remain the same.
// Percent threshold is a floating point value representing a percentage (e.g. 0.05 is 5%), and it defines a range of +/- that percentage from 100. So a 5% threshold defines a range from 95-105%.

// Spike: potential new average is above the threshold
// Dip: potential new average is below the threshold

// Note 1: First data point will always be accepted, since there is no current average to compare it with.
// Note 2: Validity is inclusive of the threshold, so potential new averages on the borderline are valid.

// Test case 1 below provides additional comments to explain how it works.

// Sliding window size: 2, Pct Threshold: 0.05
// Data array: [210.0, 185.0, 200.0]

// # No current average, no thresholds. After reading in 210.0, the potential new average is 210.0. First data point is always accepted, so the current average is now 210.0
// Read in 210.0, average is 210.0

// # Current average is 210.0, threshold is [199.5, 220.5]. After reading in 185.0, the potential new average is 197.5. Potential new average is below the threshold (dip), so 185.0 is an outlier and rejected (like it never existed). Current average remains 210.0
// Read in 185.0, average is 210.0 - dip found

// # Current average is 210.0, threshold is [199.5, 220.5]. After reading in 200.0, the potential new average is 205.0. This is within the threshold, so 200.0 is accepted and our current average is now 205.0
// Read in 200.0, average is 205.0
