"""
Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the
width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:

Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10

Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
 
Constraints:

1 <= heights.length <= 105
0 <= heights[i] <= 104
