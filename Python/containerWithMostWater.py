"""
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at
coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is
at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the
container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
