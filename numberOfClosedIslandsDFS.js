/*
Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
